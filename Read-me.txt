Before you use this, make sure to use the weapon info blob limit adjuster by alexguirre to prevent the game from crashing during loading.

Instructions [Add-On]:

1. Place the "morgan" folder into [Gamefolder]\update\X64\dlcpacks\

2. With OpenIV, extract [Game folder]\update\update.rpf\common\data\dlclist.xml and edit this with Notepad++. Add the following entry:
		<Item>dlcpacks:\morgan\</Item>

3. Now you are done, you will need a trainer with "spawn by name" function (Enhanced Native Trainer for example) to spawn the vehicle type in:

"morgan"


The MPBM sadly needs to have some vanilla/Doomsday Heist files replaced. Just follow the path inside the update folder and replace the files.



How to equip the weapons:

Use any custom ingame trainer which supports vehicle tuning. Go into the vehicle mod menu.

Under the roof section, you can equip the MPBM

Uner the front bumper section, you can equip the TLS

Please note: You have to have the Rayminigun from the Arena War DLC in your weapon wheel for the effects to work properly



I would advise using a Mods folder (more info at OpenIV) 
and make a backup, I take no responsibility if any shit happens.
